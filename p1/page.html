        For design, I was inspired by Apple. I really appreciate their ability to
        keep things simple, friendly, and presentable. So, I tried my best to
        follow these principles. 
        
        To keep it simple, I broke the body into cards.
        The cards contain an image, followed by text underneath it. I figured cards
        would be a great choice to organize and display related content.
        Cards also work great for smaller screen sizes like tablets and phones.

        I really enjoyed Apple's Big Sur graphics, so I decided to use inspired-
        images as backgrounds for both the cards and page. I went with light
        versions of red and green because they look warm and welcoming. But they
        also are complementary, providing contrast and a pop for the cards, the
        main subject of the page.

        The subject of the page is about me, specifically about things I have been
        doing recently. With a busy schedule this quarter, I'm already forgetting
        what I like doing and what I'm looking forward to. So this was a way to
        remind myself of what I am working towards. It was really relaxing and
        enjoyable to work on this assignment.

        Although there were a few struggles that came a long with it. The simplest
        issue to fix, yet the one that took me the longest was linking the style
        sheet with the html file because I didn't recognize that I misspelled `rel`
        with `ref`. After that, I ran into issues with formatting the text and
        images. Sometimes, the text would leak out of the card or the card size
        wasn't as big as I wanted it to be. Other times, I couldn't center the
        items properly. 

        Upon completing the assignment, I did learn fixes for these issues by
        getting a better understanding of `flex`, `margin`, and `padding`.

                     Hello! My name is Brandon, and I am a 4th year CS major at UC
                     Davis. Although I study at Davis, I actually live in Manteca,
                     so I actually commute 3 hours per day to attend classes... fun!
                     When I'm not studying or driving, I like to play guitar, soccer
                     ,run, and workout. Overall, I just really like being active!
                     I'm looking forward to few things this year, like graduation, 
                     getting a job, competing in a marathon, and going to EDC for
                     the first time! It's going to be a good year :)

                     Recently, I really got into snowboarding! I finally 
                     made it passed the paywall, so now I can finally enjoy
                     the slopes. Its been a really fun experience, besides
                     the catching edges part. I really enjoy hitting the 
                     fresh powder, so much so, I will skip exams if I need
                     too! I can't wait till the next season begins.
